## Description
The idea is to create an application similar to Glassdoor/LinkedIn. We want a web application that will allows companies to post job postings, let candidates apply to postings, let candidates review companies, let candidates submit their salaries. 

## Key Features
* Candidate sign-up
* Employer sign-up
* Employer adds job posting
* Candidate applies to job posting (name, address, resume, etc.)
* Candidate reviews company
* Candidates can browse companies
* User profiles for employers and candidates
* Search filter on job postings

## Beta
* Employer sign-up
* Candidate sign-up
* User profiles for both employers and candidates
* Employer adds job posting
* Candidate applies to job posting
* Employer receives application in email

## Final
* Search filter on job postings

* Candidates can browse companies

## Tech Stack
Node/Express/MongoDB for backend, React on frontend, and GraphQL for data exchange. We will deploy on a VM using Azure.

## Top 5 Challenges
